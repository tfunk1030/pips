Testing Hint Generation
============================================================

🎯 Start with Region E
   Region E requires all cells to be equal - this is very constraining! You'll need matching dominoes (like 2-2, 3-3, etc.)

💡 Other easy regions to tackle: H, G

🔍 General Strategy:
   1. Work on most constrained regions first
   2. Track which dominoes you've used
   3. Check if placements violate neighboring region constraints

⚠️  'All equal' regions (E, K) need matching dominoes
   Look for doubles in your tray: 0-0, 1-1, 2-2, etc.

📊 Two-cell sum regions are easier to solve
   Focus on: C, H, G, A, I
