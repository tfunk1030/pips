# Pips CSP (Mobile)

This repo contains an **offline-first** React Native + Expo app (TypeScript) that **solves + validates** NYT “Pips”-style puzzles by modeling them as a **constraint satisfaction problem (CSP)**.

The mobile app lives in `mobile/`.

## Run

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npm run start
```

Then open in **Expo Go** (or run `npm run android` / `npm run ios` / `npm run web`).
