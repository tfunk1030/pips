The pipeline already collects per-model responses in debug mode - this surfaces them in the UI for manual verification.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe extraction pipeline stores rawResponses from each model (Gemini, GPT, Claude) in result.debug.rawResponses when saveDebugResponses is enabled. The compareCellDetections function (gridValidator.ts lines 602-644) already computes cell-by-cell disagreement analysis. This data exists but isn't exposed to users.\n\n---\n*This spec was created from ideation and is pending detailed specification.*\n",
