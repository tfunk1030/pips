  "task_description": "# Enhanced OCR Constraint Detection\n\nImprove OCR accuracy for reading constraint numbers and text from puzzle screenshots. Currently OCR struggles with various fonts, sizes, and image qualities.\n\n## Rationale\nConstraint detection is critical for puzzle solving. Users currently experience failures when constraints aren't read correctly, requiring manual correction. Improving OCR directly addresses the pain point of 40-60% detection accuracy on complex puzzles.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a puzzle enthusiast, I want the app to correctly read constraint numbers so that I get accurate solutions\n- As a mobile user, I want OCR to work reliably with my phone's screenshot quality so that I don't have to retake photos\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] OCR correctly reads constraint numbers in 90%+ of standard puzzle screenshots\n- [ ] OCR handles different font sizes and styles\n- [ ] OCR works with both high and low resolution images\n- [ ] Preprocessing pipeline optimizes images for text recognition\n",
