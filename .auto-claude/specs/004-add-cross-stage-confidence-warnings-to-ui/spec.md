# Add Cross-Stage Confidence Warnings to UI

## Overview

Display the confidence hints generated by generateConfidenceHints() in the mobile app's extraction results screen. The backend already computes these hints but the UI only shows the overall confidence percentage.

## Rationale

The generateConfidenceHints function (pipeline.ts lines 236-282) already generates human-readable warnings like 'Low confidence in Grid dimensions' and 'Extraction confidence varies significantly across stages'. The ConfidenceSummary component exists but doesn't show these text hints.
