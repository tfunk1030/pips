=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: pips (Pips Puzzle Solver Monorepo)
Workspace: C:\Users\tfunk\pips
Started: 2025-12-22

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Repository consolidation task requiring sequential git operations with careful conflict resolution

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 6
- Total subtasks: 20
- Created init.sh
- Created context.json

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Setup and Backup): 3 subtasks, depends on []
  * Create backup tag
  * Commit staged files on copilot-fixes
  * Commit unstaged .auto-claude changes

- Phase 2 (Commit Worktree Changes): 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-1]
  * Commit changes in worktrees 001-016
  * Handle all 19 worktrees with uncommitted changes

- Phase 3 (Merge Primary Branch): 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-2]
  * Switch to main branch
  * Merge copilot-fixes (41 commits)

- Phase 4 (Merge Auto-Claude Branches): 7 subtasks, depends on [phase-3]
  * Merge 17 auto-claude feature branches sequentially

- Phase 5 (Merge Utility Branches): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-4]
  * Merge beautiful-williams, claude, codex
  * Review/merge experimental branches

- Phase 6 (Cleanup and Verification): 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-5]
  * Verify clean working tree
  * Verify cv-service imports
  * Verify pips-solver builds
  * Create final summary

Services Involved:
- repository: Git operations (commits, merges, tags)
- cv-service: Python/FastAPI backend verification
- pips-solver: TypeScript/React Native frontend verification

Branch Inventory:
- 27 total local branches
- 17 auto-claude feature branches (all with worktrees)
- 10 other branches (copilot-fixes, beautiful-williams, claude, etc.)
- Target: main branch (currently 2 commits)

Current State:
- Active branch: copilot-fixes (41 commits ahead of main)
- Staged files: 44
- Worktrees with uncommitted changes: 19

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1 (sequential git operations required)
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups: None (all phases must execute sequentially)

Risk Assessment:
- HIGH: Merge conflicts between overlapping features
- HIGH: Worktree state corruption during operations
- MEDIUM: Lost commits if changes not properly committed
- MEDIUM: Build breakage from incompatible merged code

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 017 --parallel 1

Alternative manual execution:
  1. cd C:\Users\tfunk\pips
  2. git tag backup-pre-merge-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
  3. Review and commit changes on each branch
  4. git checkout main
  5. git merge copilot-fixes
  6. git merge auto-claude/001-... (repeat for each branch)
