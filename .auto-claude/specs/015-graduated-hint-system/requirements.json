  "task_description": "# Graduated Hint System\n\nImplement a multi-level hint system that progressively reveals puzzle-solving insights without fully spoiling the solution. From strategic guidance to specific cell hints.\n\n## Rationale\nMany users want help without complete spoilers. This directly addresses the pain point of wanting to learn strategies without ruining the puzzle experience, differentiating from online solution lookups.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a puzzle learner, I want progressive hints so that I can learn without complete spoilers\n- As a casual player, I want a nudge to get unstuck without revealing the whole solution\n- As a power user, I want to understand why a placement is correct, not just what it is\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Level 1: General strategy hints without revealing specifics\n- [ ] Level 2: Identify which region or constraint to focus on\n- [ ] Level 3: Reveal a specific cell placement as a nudge\n- [ ] Level 4: Show partial solution for stuck areas\n- [ ] Users can progress through hint levels at their own pace\n",
