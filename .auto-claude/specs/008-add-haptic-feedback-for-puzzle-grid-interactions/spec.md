# Add haptic feedback for puzzle grid interactions

## Overview

The interactive grid overlay in Step1GridAlignment (dragging edges, tapping cells to mark holes) lacks haptic feedback. React Native supports Haptics which would enhance the tactile feel matching the 'Tactile Game Table' design aesthetic.

## Rationale

Haptic feedback is essential for touch-based grid manipulation, providing confirmation that interactions registered. This is especially important for precise operations like grid alignment and cell selection. The design system is named 'Tactile Game Table' but lacks tactile feedback.
