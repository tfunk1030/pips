=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: PIPS Monorepo - Git Branch Consolidation
Spec: 017-merge-auto-claude-branches-into-copilot-fixes
Workspace: C:\Users\tfunk\pips
Started: 2025-12-22

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Implements a specific git branch consolidation process requiring careful
sequential execution, verification at each step, and potential conflict resolution.
While it doesn't modify application code, it implements a new branch management procedure.

Session 1 (Planner):
✓ Created implementation_plan.json
✓ Phases: 4
✓ Total subtasks: 10
✓ Created init.sh (pre-flight check script)
✓ Created build-progress.txt

Phase Summary:

Phase 1: Preparation & Validation (3 subtasks)
  - Validate repository state and create pre-merge backup
  - Handle uncommitted changes on copilot-fixes branch
  - Identify and count all auto-claude branches to merge
  - Depends on: None
  - Status: PENDING

Phase 2: Commit Uncommitted Changes (3 subtasks)
  - Process branches 001-005: commit uncommitted changes
  - Process branches 006-010: commit uncommitted changes
  - Process branches 011-017: commit uncommitted changes
  - Depends on: Phase 1
  - Status: PENDING

Phase 3: Merge Branches into Copilot-Fixes (3 subtasks)
  - Merge branches 001-005 into copilot-fixes
  - Merge branches 006-010 into copilot-fixes
  - Merge branches 011-017 into copilot-fixes
  - Depends on: Phase 2
  - Status: PENDING

Phase 4: Verification & Documentation (1 subtask)
  - Verify all 17 branches are merged into copilot-fixes
  - Verify repository integrity and no merge artifacts
  - Document merge operation in build-progress.txt
  - Depends on: Phase 3
  - Status: PENDING

Services Involved:
- Repository-wide (git operations only, no code services)

Git State (at planning time):
- Current branch: copilot-fixes
- Auto-claude branches found: 17
  * auto-claude/001-enhance-ai-visual-pips-board-extraction-accuracy
  * auto-claude/002-add-domino-tray-preprocessing

  * auto-claude/017-commit-and-merge-all-feature-branches

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1 (sequential only)
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups: None
- Reasoning: Git merge operations must be sequential to maintain clean state and
  handle potential conflicts. Each merge depends on the previous merge completing
  successfully.

Verification Strategy:
- Risk Level: low
- Test Types Required: None (git operations only)
- Security Scanning: Not required
- Staging Deployment: Not required

QA Acceptance Criteria:
- All 17 auto-claude branches successfully merged into copilot-fixes
- No merge conflicts remain unresolved
- Working directory is clean (git status shows no uncommitted changes)
- No merge artifact markers (<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) in codebase
- Git repository integrity verified (git fsck passes)
- All branches appear in 'git branch --merged copilot-fixes'
- Merge history is preserved and visible in git log
- Pre-merge backup tag exists for rollback capability
- Build-progress.txt documents the operation
- All service directories remain intact

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 017 --parallel 1

Example:
  cd C:\Users\tfunk\pips
  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate
  python auto-claude/run.py --spec 017 --parallel 1

Pre-flight check (optional):
  cd C:\Users\tfunk\pips\.auto-claude\specs\017-merge-auto-claude-branches-into-copilot-fixes
  ./init.sh

=== END SESSION 1 (PLANNER) ===

Next Session: Implementation Agent will execute git operations
