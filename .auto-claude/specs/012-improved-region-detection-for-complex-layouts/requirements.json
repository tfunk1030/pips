  "task_description": "# Improved Region Detection for Complex Layouts\n\nEnhance region detection algorithms to handle complex puzzle layouts with irregular shapes, overlapping colors, and non-standard grid patterns.\n\n## Rationale\nRegion detection is imperfect on complex layouts, causing frustration for users with challenging puzzles - exactly when they need help most. This addresses the known gap in grid dimension estimation for irregular layouts.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a user with a complex puzzle, I want the app to correctly identify all regions so that I can get help on the hardest puzzles\n- As a mobile user, I want region detection to work even with slight image distortions from camera angles\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Region contours correctly identified for 85%+ of puzzles\n- [ ] Color segmentation handles gradients and similar colors\n- [ ] Grid dimensions accurately estimated for irregular layouts\n- [ ] Fallback strategies when primary detection fails\n",
